File: Security

Sites can check what security restrictions it has through the songbird javascript object using the <Songbird::hasAccess()> function. Before trying to access these areas of the <Songbird> object a check should be done to verify that the current site has access to the area required.

Security Catagories:
+ "Control Playback" - Access to commands like play and pause,
+ "Read Current" - Access to read information like currentArtist.
+ "Read Library" - Access to reading library information.
+ "Add Media" - Access to write library information.
+ "Create Medialists" - Access to create new libraries.

Example (Proper way):

(start code)
  ...
  /*
   * Grab the current playing artist
   * Returns "N/A" if unable to retrieve artist.
   */
  function getArtistName ()
  {
    var artistName = "N/A";
    
    if (songbird.hasAccess("Read Current"))
    {
      artistName = songbird.currentArtist;
    }
    
    return artistName;
  }
  
  document.write("Current Playing artist is: " + getArtistName() + "<br />");
  ...
(end)

Example (Bad way):

(start code)
  ...
  /*
   * Grab the current playing artist
   * Returns "N/A" if unable to retrieve artist.
   */
  function getArtistName ()
  {
    var artistName = "N/A";
    
    try
    {
      artistName = songbird.currentArtist;
      /*
       * If you do not have access to read songbird.currentArtist
       * Then an exception will be thrown and your function will fail
       */
    } catch (errException)
      /*
       *  JavaScript error: , line ####: uncaught exception: Permission denied 
       *  to get property Songbird Remote Player.currentArtist
       */
       alert(errException);
    }
    return artistName;
  }
  
  document.write("Current Playing artist is: " + getArtistName() + "<br />");
  ...
(end)
