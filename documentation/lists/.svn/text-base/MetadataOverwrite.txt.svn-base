File: Metadata Updates

When a <MediaItem> gets played, it's metadata may change because the playback 
core is offering new metadata about this <MediaItem> that wasn't available when 
metadata was first read from it because it was added to a <Library>. 

Following is a description of all cases where metadata may be overwritten 
automatically.

1 - Artist/Album/Genre will be overwritten only if there is no value in the
database.

2 - Title will be overwritten only if there is no value or if the value is
equal to what it calculates the "default" value should be based on the url. 

Because we set the "default" value upon insertion via the page scraper, or media
import, we want to make sure to overwrite it if there's more complete metadata now 
available.

3 - Length will always be overwritten if the core returns a "real" length.  We
assume that the core knows better than we do, though that is not necessarily
the case with some VBR files where the length calculation becomes progressively
more correct over time but can be wildly incorrect in the beginning on some
<MediaItems>.

If you want to ensure that your metadata is always displayed, you will have to 
create alternate properties for your metadata and add columns for these 
properties. After doing so, you may hide the default columns so only your 
metadata is displayed.
