        Maybe you headed here because you can't get something to work? There is
        a list of known problems on
        <a href="http://addons.songbirdnest.com/addons/1535">FolderSync's
        comments page</a>.

      <h1 id="about">About This Manual</h1>
      <p>
        Folder synchronisation is available as AddOn for
        <a href="http://getsongbird.com">Songbird</a>, FolderSync, and as
        built-in feature in <a href="http://getnightingale.com">Nightingale</a>.
        There are no differences between those two versions; this manual applies
        to both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within this manual, brown links will guide you to other content, while
        blue links refer to additional content from the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        This manual contains some screenshots, those are taken from the
        FolderSync AddOn currently. Because the look of the UI differs depending
        on the feather (skin for Songbird / Nightingale) installed,
        each screenshot was made in "Purple Rain" (Songbird's default feather)
        and "simplyBlack". "Purple Rain"-Screenshots are on the left hand side
        or above (on small screens / browser windows).

        On the bottom of each pages you can see what version the manual page
        relates to, it might happen that new features are available within the
        version you have installed. You can also see the language of the manual
        you're using; other languages' content might cover newer versions.

        If you have any ideas how to improve this manual or the Folder
        Synchronisation Feature / FolderSync AddOn itself, you spotted a mistake
        or you want to help with a translation into a different language, feel
