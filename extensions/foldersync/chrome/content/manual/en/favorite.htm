        You can save syncs you use often as favorite sync, so you don't need to
        enter all sync-specific information every time you want to perform it.
        To work with favorite syncs it is needed you understood
        <a href="sync.htm">how to perform a sync</a>.

        To create or update a favorite Sync, go to <a href="sync.htm#tab">the
        synchronisation tab</a> and set the sync to save as favorite up the
        <a href="sync.htm#start">same way as you would set up a normal sync</a>.
        If you want to update a sync you might want to <a href="#load">load</a>
        the sync to get updated before doing the changes.
        Instead of clicking at the start sync button, you now use the button
        "Save as Favorite" to save the current sync as a new favorite sync, or
        you select a favorite sync to update in the favorite sync area at
        the top of the tab, and then take "Update Favorite Sync" to overwrite it
        with the current sync.

      <h1 id="load">Load a Favorite Sync</h2>
      <p>
        To update a favorite sync or to perform a slightly different sync, you
        might want to load the favorite sync's values into the user interface.
        To do so, select the favorite sync you want to load in the favorite sync
        area at the top of the tab, and click the "Load" button on the right hand
        side of it.
      </p>
      
      <h1 id="start">Perform a Favorite Sync</h1>
      <p>
        To start a favorite sync, select it in the favorite sync area at the top
        of the tab, and choose "Start" on the right hand side of it.
      </p>
      
      <h1 id="delete">Delete a Favorite Sync</h1>
      <p>
        If you don't need a favorite sync anymore, you can delete it by selecting
        it in the favorite sync area on the top and choosing the "Delete..." button
        on the right hand side of it.
