        This chapter describes how to sync your Library or parts of it with a
        folder of your choice. After covering the <a href="#concept">basic
        ideas folder synchronisation</a> is based on, this will describe how
        to use the <a href="#tab">synchronisation tab</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h1 id="concept">The Folder Synchronisation Concept</h1>
      <p>
        The sync's options are divided into two parts: the profile, which stores all
        options that are not related to one specific sync, and the options only related
        to a specific sync. A profile stores information, how the Sync should get
        performed, for example it saves weather files should get deleted if they aren't
        part of the sync or not. After you configured a profile, you can use it for a
        specific sync, so after choosing the profile you specify what playlists should
        get synced to what folder. The profile configuration features are covered by
        <a href="profiles.htm">another chapter</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h1 id ="tab">The Synchronisation Tab</h1>
      <p>
        The synchronisation tab can be used to start syncs, and to monitor current sync's status.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Accessing the Synchronisation Tab</h2>
      <p>
        After installing FolderSync and restarting Songbird to complete the installation,
        or after the first start of Nightingale you can access the Synchronisation tab via
        clicking the entry "FolderSync" or "Synchronisation" in the "Library" section of
        the service pane (located on the left).
      </p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="images/songbird-normal-pr.png" />
        <img src="images/songbird-normal-sb.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The exact position might differ, depending on what feather (skin for Songbird)
        and other AddOns you use. The sidebar might be on another position, there might
        be additional entries in it, for example "Radio", when using SHOUTcast, DirectTune
        and/or BirdTune.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="tablayout">Tab Layout</h2>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="images/foldersynctab-pr.png" />
        <img src="images/foldersynctab-sb.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        As you can see on the screenshots above, the tab is divided into four parts:
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part consists of the logo above all other features. On the right hand
        side there is information about syncs running or in queue. We'll take a closer
        look at queueing and monitoring features <a href="#monitor">later</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second one is &quot;Favorite Syncs&quot;, a feature to 'bookmark' syncs you
        preform often. Favorite Syncs are covered in <a href="favorite.htm">another chapter</a>
        of this manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third part is used to start a sync, which will be the <a href="#start">next aspect</a> to cover in
        this manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last part contains buttons that should help you: a link to the <a href="preferences.htm">Preferences</a>, the comment page</a> and this manual.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="start">Starting a Sync</h2>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="images/syncarea-pr.png" />
        <img src="images/syncarea-sb.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, you will only have to enter information related to the specific
        sync you want to start; general Sync-related options are bundeled in
        <a href="profiles.htm">profiles</a>. You can select the profile to use for the sync
        in the &quot;Current profile:&quot;-box.
      <p>
        The next specific information needed is what playlists you want to sync.
        If you created a new playlist since you opened
        the tab, you might have to use the &quot;Refresh&quot;-button to make it
        appear in the list. The same issue affects deleted playlists: playlists deleted
        since you opened the tab will only disappear after you refreshed the list. To
        include a playlist into the sync, check the box in front of it.
        The box on the left gets updated when you change your selection and displays the
        file size of all currently selected playlists when using the currently choosen
        profile (profiles may want songs to get copied for each playlist they are in,
        instead of only one time for every playlist).
      </p>
      <p>
        The last information needed is the target Folder: you might want to use the
        browse button or enter the path by yourself. Enter the path as you would
        enter it into any other application, use the platform-specific syntax (so
        Windows users might use 'Z:\Music', Linux users '/media/mp3/Music').
      </p>
      <p>
        If you finished entering all needed information, use the
        &quot;Start Sync&quot;-button to start the sync.
        <span class="highlight">Caution:</span> depending on the profile &quot;Start
        Sync&quot; may delete files (although that is not the default behaviour).
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="monitor">Monitoring Syncs and the Sync Queue</h3>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, while syncs are running you can see their state on the
        right hand side of the logo:
      </p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="images/queue-pr.png" />
        <img src="images/queue-sb.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        There is only one sync running, there is no possibility to run syncs
        simultaneously. If you start another sync while a sync is performed,
        the new sync will go into the sync queue and will get performed after
        the current sync finished. You can cancel the current sync with the button
        &quot;Cancel&quot;, and you can drop the whole queue via using the button
        &quot;Cancel all&quot;. The bottom part with the &quot;Cancel all&quot;
        button is only visible if there are syncs in the sync queue.
      </p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="images/completed-pr.png" />
        <img src="images/completed-sb.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        After a sync finished, you see a notification above the status field.
        You can use the cross on the right hand side of the notification to close
        it, and see the status line again. This is because you wouldn't see the
        result of a sync if it would be displayed in the status field only when
        syncs are queued; new syncs would cause the result of old syncs to hide.
        If a sync failed, its notification will stay over notifications from syncs
        that succeeded, if there is more than one notification.
      </p>
      <div class="imagerow">
        <img src="images/completed-global-pr.png" />
        <img src="images/completed-global-sb.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        If you leave the tab, syncs will get performed in background.
        You will see a message (if you didn't change
        <a href="preferences.htm#notification">the preference for it</a>) if a sync
        is completed, see screenshot above. If
        there are syncs running, the small logo in the servicepane (on the
        left) will spin.
