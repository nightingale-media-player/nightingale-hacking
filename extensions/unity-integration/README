Component build instructions:
-----------------------------
There is a component in components directory which is a core and makes it possible to call functions from ubuntu libraries.
To rebuild it you will need:
Gecko 1.9.2 SDK - http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/3.6.27/sdk/xulrunner-3.6.27.en-US.linux-i686.sdk.tar.bz2
libunity development files
libnotify development files
Development files for the GTK+ library

1. Unpack Gecko 1.9.2 SDK for example to your home directory
2. Install libunity development files with: 'sudo apt-get install libunity-dev'
3. Install libnotify development files with: 'sudo apt-get install libnotify-dev'
4. Install Development files for the GTK+ library: 'sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev' or\and maybe 'sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev'
5. Edit Makefile in Unity Integration components directory and change on the line:
GECKO_SDK_PATH = $(HOME)/xulrunner-sdk
path to point to your gecko sdk directory (no need to change if you just unpacked it to your home directory)

To rebuild component just change directory to the components directory and run make
