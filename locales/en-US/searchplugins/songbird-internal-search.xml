<!-- HACK: 
     
     gSearchHandler intercepts searches for this engine and sends queries
     directly to the appropriate playlist.
         
     Be aware that this is a temporary solution, and was necessary in order extend 
     the Firefox search system to meet Songbird's needs. 
     This is guaranteed to change at some point in the future. 
     
     Note that engines with songbird:internal are hidden on startup, and need to 
     be programmatically shown.     
     
     See searchHandler.js and sb-search.xml for more information.
