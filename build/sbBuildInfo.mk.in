# There is a mishmash of make- and ini-style variable declarations in this file
# because we have to support older (1.1.x) style names for a bit longer;
# declaring them as ini-style, and then redefining them in make-style is
# messy, but makes it so we don't have to write 2 cases in the parser code;
# this can be removed when we're not using the buildbots to building the 
# 1.1-branch anymore.

# Why is there no RepoRevisionClient, you ask? We have to treat client-pull
# revisions slightly differently, because we modify the repo itself whenever
# we do a build (bookend-build.py). The svn revision given below is done via
# keyword substitution, so in the common case (svn up to HEAD, in the daily
# case), it should be correct.
# BUT, it's provided merely as a convenience; the build system/buildbots rely on
# master-build-info.txt, which is sitting in the root of this repository...
# and if you want to be 100% sure/correct, so should you..
