# Where sourcepath is the folder containing the soon-to-be-jarred content

# Fed a jar.mn file through STDIN, this script looks for extra 
# processing instructions.
#
# Supported instructions:
#
#   @include_all_to [destination]
#        Adds all files in the source folder to the jar manifest
#        using the given destination path.
#

--- WARNING ---
expand-jar-mn.pl was aborted due to presence of file with non-whitelisted 
file extension.  

Offending file: $file

If this extension is valid, modify tools/scripts/expand-jar-mn.pl line 74.

Better yet, make Ben do it.  This was his idea.
