GLOBAL STYLES

Whereas songbird.css is loaded only by Songbird windows, global.css 
is loaded into all windows and dialogs in the application 
(provided that the Songbird global skin is active).

When the Songbird global skin is the active provider for the 
chrome://global/skin package, chrome://global/skin/global.css will 
in turn import this global.css file. The Songbird global skin, 
located at /app/skin/global and chrome://songbird-global/skin/, 
is used with feathers that want complete control over the look and
feel of the application.

This file can be used to pull in additional styles that should be
present everywhere in the application.
