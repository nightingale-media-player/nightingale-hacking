Congratulations, you've downloaded a nightly build... this means you're running
what we're running: cutting edge, bleeding new bits that have no guarantee
*whatsoever*.  Could it trash your library?  Possibly.  Could it crash in
wonderful newfound ways?  Definitely.  Could it make your computer do the
macarena?  Not likely, but if it does - we'd love to see a bug filed.

These nightly builds are provided for:
1) Developers wanting to developer new add-ons or website integrations using
newly delivered APIs that aren't fully baked into a regular release yet.
2) Awesome users who want to test our latest stuff to find and fix bugs and who
don't mind a little pain.

If you're running an old nightly, please remember you can always grab the
latest nightly at:
http://publicsvn.songbirdnest.com/wiki/Nightly_Builds

If you think you've found a bug, please ensure you can reproduce with a recent
nightly and file your bug at http://bugzilla.songbirdnest.com
